**INDUSTRIAL TRAINING RESEARCH**

This a log of my industrial training, detailing the process of Operating System kernel research with a trial on a simple kernel to be loaded from a floppy disk. It involves learning how a computer starts, how it manages memory, and how to write core code that runs before any major system like Windows or Linux has loaded.

**_Project Goal:_**

Writing a bootloader and a kernel from scratch as part of my Industrial Training.
