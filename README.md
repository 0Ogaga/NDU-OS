# ⚙️ NDU-OS: Industrial Training Project

## 🎯 Project Goal
Building a minimal Operating System kernel from scratch as part of my Industrial Training.

## 🚀 Current Status: Phase 1 Complete
I've successfully configured the toolchain (WSL, NASM, QEMU) and ran my first two-stage system:
1. A **512-byte Assembly Bootloader** that handles disk I/O.
2. A simple **C-Kernel** that is loaded and executed.

My next step is to transition the CPU to **32-bit Protected Mode**.
