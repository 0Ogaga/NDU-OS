#  Full Development Log: NDU-OS Journey

This log tracks all architectural decisions, challenges encountered, solutions, and lessons learned chronologically.

**Phase 0** - _Research and Planning_

Before any code was written, the initial phase was dedicated to gaining a high-level conceptual understanding of the operating system structure and identifying the necessary technical tools. This ensured the project had a clear path forward.

1. Conceptual Overview (The "What" and "Why")
2. The first step was to understand the fundamental components we planned to build:Operating System (OS)Concept: An OS is the primary piece of software that manages all the computer's hardware and software resources. It acts as an intermediary between the user/applications and the physical hardware.Key Function: We focused on the Kernel, which is the core of the OS. The kernel handles critical tasks like memory management, process scheduling, and interacting with hardware drivers. Our project's goal is to build this kernel.BootloaderConcept: This is the first piece of code executed when a computer powers on. It is incredibly small (often exactly 512 bytes) and runs in the CPU's initial, limited 16-bit Real Mode.Key Function: The bootloader's sole job is to initialize the system, load the main OS kernel into memory, and transfer control to it. It is the bridge between the computer's BIOS (firmware) and our kernel.2. Tools and Materials Identification (The "How")Based on the goal of building a bare-metal kernel, the following required materials were identified:Software ToolchainToolPurpose IdentifiedStatusAssembly LanguageRequired for the bootloader, as it needs direct, low-level hardware control and extreme size efficiency.Selected (NASM dialect)C LanguageRequired for the main kernel code due to its efficiency and proximity to the hardware, while still offering structure.Selected (Will require a Cross-Compiler)Emulator (QEMU)A safe environment to run and debug the OS code, as running on a host machine is complex and risky.IdentifiedBuild Automation (make)Necessary to simplify the compilation and linking process, which involves multiple file types and precise ordering.Identified
